# HW-5

#Description 
My motivation to create this project was to learn more about the functionality of javascript and explore/learn more about javascript. I built this project to make a Work day scheduler so that anyone can plan out their daily schedule without their plans when refreshing the browser. The main problem that this project solves is having to remember every work plan a person has in their head. This scheduler makes a persons' life easier since by using this scheduler they can have a place where they can note down every event they have during the 9-5 schedule. I learned many different and new component while I was dealing with the javascript; for starters I have reviewed learned how to create rows and also apply css through bootstrap. Another thing had trouble with but later figured out was the local storage so that the user can save their content even after refreshing the browser.

#Installation 
My first step was to read and use the instructions on the files as a guide so that I could build this porject. The second step was to create the date on the top of the page and then make sure it updates to the current day. The second step was to put the entries for the 9 to 5 work day schedule. Then was to the get item to collect the local storage data then to make sure the scheduler updates to the current day as well. The next step was to create the rows with bootstrap with included classes to shape the rows. The following step was to makes a function to change the colors of the rows based on the current time and they are set with the classes past, future, and present. The next step was for the save button to work when the user put content in the row then clicked the save button. The final step was to set item for the local storage to work. 

#Usage 
1. The first step for the user is to make their plans throughout their work day

2. The user plans show in the rows. The rows are color coordinated; green rows are the future plans, red are the current time plans, and grey rows are the past hours. The user can keep their plans even after they refresh the browser.
